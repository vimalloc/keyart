BASICS
------
To create a worksheet for a keysigning party, you will need to export each of
the participants keys to their own file in a directory. If you've been storing
them in a separate keyring, this should be easy.

Once each key is in its own file, create a single "art.txt" file with all the
keys. Something like:

    $ for KEY in *.gpg; do keyart $KEY; done > art.txt

In the examples/ directory of this documentation, is a 'party.sh' script that
can transform that art.txt file to 5 key art per line. It will print the output
to STDOUT. So, you could redirect to a file with:

    $ ./party.sh > worksheet.txt

Open 'worksheet.txt' in a text editor, and add newlines as necessary, so the
key art is not broken by a page break. Use your text editor 'print preview' for
help.

Print off your modified 'worksheet.txt' for each key signing party attendee.

COLOR WORKSHEET
---------------
If you would like to create an ANSI colored worksheet, you can install the
Python "ansi2html" library, and redirect your output to an HTML file, which
could then be used to print the worksheet:

    $ sudo easy_install ansi2html
    $ for KEY in *.gpg; do keyart -a $KEY; done > art.txt
    $ ./party.sh | ansi2html > worksheet.html

You may need to make some HTML adjustments to prevent the printer from breaking
up the key art on the page break. Use your browser's 'print preview' for help.
